🚀 Pneumonia X-ray Detection using Deep Learning

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be detected through chest X-ray images. I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that analyzes X-ray images and predicts whether a patient has pneumonia or not.

🔍 How It Works:

The model is trained on a dataset of chest X-rays, learning to differentiate between normal and pneumonia-infected lungs.
It processes uploaded X-ray images and provides a prediction with high accuracy.
The project is deployed using Streamlit, making it easy to access from any browser.
