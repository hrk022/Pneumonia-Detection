# 🚀 Pneumonia X-ray Detection using Deep Learning  

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be detected through chest X-ray images. I developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model that analyzes X-ray images and predicts whether a patient has pneumonia or not.  

## 🔍 How It Works:

- The model is trained on a dataset of chest X-rays, learning to differentiate between normal and pneumonia-infected lungs.
- It processes uploaded X-ray images and provides a prediction with high accuracy.
- The project is deployed using **Streamlit**, making it easy to access from any browser.
